# Patches awaiting a push with the `workflow` scope

A change under `.github/workflows/` can only be pushed by a credential
that holds GitHub's `workflow` scope. When a writing session does not
have that scope, the change travels here instead as a patch against
`main`, for a maintainer to apply and push.

Remove the patch in the same change that applies it, so this folder
holds only what is still pending. `git am` keeps the patch's author and
records you as committer, so `user.name` and `user.email` must be set;
add `--reset-author` to the amend below to take the commit as your own.

## Pending patches

None.
